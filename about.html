    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I have been told repeatedly “You should write a book”. I gave in to the pressure and wrote “Hot Pursuit” knowing that God wanted me to write it. Being unsure of what to do with it, I went on the internet and started reading about publishers. When I looked at, “Firebaptized Publishing”, the Holy Spirit fell on me like a ton of bricks. I got the message and read their website. It said they did not accept autobiographies. I tried to text them and then I tried to write them a letter. Their site said they didn’t want what I was offering and I got very frustrated working on that letter. After many attempts I said, “Lord, this is not working. I can’t write this letter!” The Holy Spirit said, “You wrote a book and you can’t write a letter?” You can stop laughing at me now because you’re not perfect either. I wrote the letter while laughing at myself and they eventually published “Hot Pursuit”.</p>
    <p>If I could ask anything of my readers, it would be the following two things. I would be very thankful if you would include my family and myself in your prayers. Secondly, please join me in praying for the lost. I have never been motivated by money when sharing my testimony. My only desire is that God would continue to use it to touch hearts and bring many more into His kingdom.</p>
    <p>In His service,</p>
    <p>- Ken Burton</p>
