            <p class="summery">I lived a life of violence, crime, and drugs. A fugitive for ten years running from a 25 to 40 year prison sentence. The police were everywhere I turned. I walked in on drug busts more than once and evaded a roadblock they set up for me. They used dogs to chase me through the forest during the winter without success. I was ready to end my own life before I let someone put me in a cage again.</p>

              <p>While leaping into the car, I got down on the floor, and said, “Get out of here quickly!” As he drove out, I asked him if he could see the police. He looked up at his mirror and said, “Yes, they’re driving in the other driveway of the restaurant now.” </p>

            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>One day I volunteered to run an errand to the office supply store across the street from where I worked. On my return trip, I noticed a police cruiser passing on the opposite side of the street. He thought he recognized me from my mugshot and made a U-turn on that very busy downtown Toronto Street. He leaped out of his car and confronted me there on the sidewalk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>After locating a table where everybody could be watched, I sat down, with a drink. Within three minutes, a car drove up alongside the building. A man that I knew was a Mountie, out of uniform, walked into the restaurant. He ordered a coffee and sat in front of the bus driver. This undercover cop had no intentions of making a move inside the building nor would it be when we returned to the bus. He had come in alone to get a good look at me and verified that I was on the bus. A roadblock would be set up a few miles down the road. They were probably thinking it would be easier to surround a bus on the highway than to rush into a restaurant, where things could get messy.  He was giving the bus driver instructions on what he should do.</p>

            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>A young couple drove from Toronto to visit the farm and were able to park their car a few feet off the road. We were standing by their car talking when two cars drove up, both filled with R.C.M.P. The snow was deeper than I am tall in places. I dreaded running in the bitterly cold weather and decided I'd better try to bluff my way through.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>Some of the Mounties got out of their cars and starting asking me questions. My answers were unable to satisfy them and running seemed to be my next best option. Knowing a hail of gunfire could stop me from ever reaching my goal, I began running to the distant forest. Evidently I took The Mounties by complete surprise. They thought I could not get far in such cold weather and deep snow, so they didn't pursue me immediately. They had underestimated my determination to elude capture. Apparently it didn't take them long to realize the seriousness of that error.  They eventually brought in dogs that picked up my trail. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>Running was incredibly slow. Every step was a struggle against the snow and bitter cold. My efforts to escape looked even more dismal when I came to the shallow end of a lake with a huge marshy area covered with ice and snow. The marsh went right up to the road, which, by now, would be infested with Mounties. The lake was much too big to go around leaving me with an unpleasant choice. I began crossing the marsh when my worst fears were realized. The ice was thinner than I had hoped and it broke. My feet were soaked and I began to wonder how long before they would freeze.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p>My muscles had become too cold to function properly. Thinking clearly was becoming a problem. Weariness started to destroy my sense of urgency. It must have been near midnight when I recognized the danger I was in. The cold would freeze me to death if I failed to seek help quickly. No one was going to put me in a cage again and I refused to lie down in the snow and give up. There was a small cabin with lights still burning ahead of me. Dragging myself to their door, at that late hour, I knocked, and hoped for the best.</p>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>I have been told repeatedly “You should write a book”. I gave in to the pressure and wrote “Hot Pursuit” knowing that God wanted me to write it. Being unsure of what to do with it, I went on the internet and started reading about publishers. When I looked at, “Firebaptized Publishing”, the Holy Spirit fell on me like a ton of bricks. I got the message and read their website. It said they did not accept autobiographies. I tried to text them and then I tried to write them a letter. Their site said they didn’t want what I was offering and I got very frustrated working on that letter. After many attempts I said, “Lord, this is not working. I can’t write this letter!” The Holy Spirit said, “You wrote a book and you can’t write a letter?” You can stop laughing at me now because you’re not perfect either. I wrote the letter while laughing at myself and they eventually published “Hot Pursuit”. </p>
            <p>If I could ask anything of my readers, it would be the following two things. I would be very thankful if you would include my family and myself in your prayers. Secondly, please join me in praying for the lost. I have never been motivated by money when sharing my testimony. My only desire is that God would continue to use it to touch hearts and bring many more into His kingdom.</p>
            <p>In His service,</p>
            <p>- Ken Burton</p>
