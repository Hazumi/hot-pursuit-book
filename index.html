    <h2>The Hot Pursuit Book</h2>
    <p>When I rode with the motorcycle club, I wore the same dirty clothes for months and used all kinds of drugs including LSD, speed, psilocybin, marijuana, hashish and alcohol. I carried a crowbar and a meat cleaver, but later found a gun to be more practical. My hair was very long. I wore an earring, and ring in my nose. My involvement in crime led to another arrest. That time the police said I was facing 20 years to life on each of two charges. The trial took place without me. A jury found me guilty and the judge sentenced me. A federal warrant for flight to avoid prosecution was issued. The next ten years were spent as a fugitive with the cops in hot pursuit.</p>

    <h2>The police had entered the building...</h2>
    <p>On another occasion when I was living in a boarding house, I heard someone speaking in the hall way. Being on the second floor, I opened my door slowly and looked down the stairway to see who it was. The police had entered the building and were speaking to my landlord. I could hear them well enough to tell they were looking for someone. There was a small chance they had the building surrounded.</p>
    <p>I was on the second floor and knew it would not be easy to slip away unnoticed. I thought my best opportunity for escape was to hide in someone else's room. I remember picking up a large kitchen knife as I hid myself in another room. I was prepared to end my life rather than be locked up forever. The police did not search the entire building and I was eventually able to make my escape.</p>
